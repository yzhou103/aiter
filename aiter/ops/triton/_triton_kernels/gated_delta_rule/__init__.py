"""
Gated Delta Rule Operations (Forward Only).

This module provides optimized Triton kernels for gated delta rule computations.

Available operations:
- Fused recurrent forward: _fused_recurrent_gated_delta_rule_fwd_kernel
- Chunk-based forward: chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd
- Hidden state computation: chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd_h
- Output computation: chunk_fwd_o

Note: Only forward pass is implemented. Backward pass is not supported in aiter.
      For training with gradients, please use the flash-linear-attention library.
