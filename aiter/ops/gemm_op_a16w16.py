    SplitK a16w16 ASM kernels use an atomic-counter protocol where the last
    workgroup performs the reduction phase. Concurrent launches on different
    streams must not share the same atomic counter, or the counts get mixed
    and the reduction phase never fires (deadlock).

    Reuse across launches on the same stream relies on the kernel resetting
    the counter to zero after the reduction completes; do not call this from
    callers that violate that invariant.

    Workspace size is small (~4 KB) and stream count per process is typically
    < 8, so the LRU cap of 64 leaves plenty of headroom before any in-flight
    workspace risks being evicted.
