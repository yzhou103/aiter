Fused Gated RMSNorm + FP8 Group Quantization

Operations:
1. Per-head Gated RMSNorm: norm(x) * silu(z) where:
   - norm(x) = x * weight / sqrt(variance + eps) (standard RMSNorm)
   - silu(z) = z / (1 + exp(-z))
2. Flatten: [num_tokens, num_heads, head_dim] -> [num_tokens, num_heads*head_dim]
3. FP8 group quantization with group_size=128

Constraint: ONLY supports head_dim=128 and group_size=128
