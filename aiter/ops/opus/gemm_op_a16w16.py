Opus a16w16 Python user-facing API.

Public entry points:

* `gemm_a16w16_opus(A, B, bias=None, dtype=bf16, *, kernelId=None, splitK=None, out=None)`
  Shape-driven wrapper. The typical user writes `gemm_a16w16_opus(A, B)`
  and never sees a kid number. Internal path:

    1. Reshape A/B to 3D, allocate Y, validate (bias allowed across the
       split-barrier / splitk kid families; bpreshuffle and non-bf16 A/B
       unsupported).
    2. If `kernelId` is given explicitly -> opus_gemm_a16w16_tune (bias
       is forwarded; the C++ dispatcher rejects non-bias-aware kids).
    3. Otherwise query the global aiter BF16 tuned CSVs via
       aiter.ops.opus.common (filtered by `libtype == 'opus'`, key
       includes bias=True/False); on hit -> opus_gemm_a16w16_tune
       with the tuned (solidx, splitK).
    4. On miss -> fall through to the private bf16 no-scale binding
       `_opus_gemm_bf16_dispatch`, which forwards to the C++ entry
       `opus_gemm` whose bf16 branch does its own lookup + heuristic
       dispatch (see csrc/opus_gemm/opus_gemm.cu). bias is forwarded
       through this path: the C++ entry skips its bias-agnostic lookup
       map when bias is present and goes straight to the heuristic
       dispatcher (which always returns a bias-aware kid).

* `opus_gemm_a16w16_tune(XQ, WQ, Y, bias, kernelId, splitK)`
  Low-level pybind binding to the id-based tune dispatcher. Exposes a
  specific kernel instance by `kernelId` plus optional literal KBatch
  via `splitK` and an optional bias tensor (D_OUT-typed, [N] or
  [batch, N]; F.linear convention). Intended for the tuner, for debugging a specific kid,
  and for aiter-global integrations (e.g. future tuned_gemm.solMap).

All entry points share the JIT module `module_deepgemm_opus`, which
still hosts bindings for other opus kernel families (a8w8 etc.). The
Python surface is deliberately per-dtype: a16w16 here, a8w8 in its own
module when that lands.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : [M, K] or [batch, M, K], bf16
    B : bf16 weight, plain layout (not pre-shuffled). Two accepted shapes:
        * [N, K]            -- requires batch == 1 (i.e. A is 2D, or A is
                               3D with leading dim 1).
        * [batch, N, K]     -- contiguous strides (N*K, K, 1) only.
                               Broadcast views (e.g. ``B.unsqueeze(0).
                               expand(batch, -1, -1)``) are rejected
                               because the opus launcher assumes
                               ``stride_b_batch == N*K``; pass
                               ``.contiguous()`` if you need to broadcast
                               a single-batch weight across A.
    bias : optional per-output-feature bias (F.linear convention), dtype
        must equal `dtype` (match_d_out). Accepted shapes:
        * [N]                  -- broadcast across batch.
        * [batch, N]           -- per-batch bias vector.
        bias is consumed by the a16w16 split-barrier (kid 4..9) and the
        a16w16_flatmm_splitk (kid 200..299) families. CSV-miss requests
        with bias fall back to the C++ heuristic dispatcher (which only
        returns bias-aware kids), so any (M, N, K) is supported even
        without a tuned bias-aware winner -- accuracy is preserved at
        whatever the heuristic kid achieves; performance may not be
        optimal until the shape is re-tuned with `--bias`.
    dtype : output dtype, bf16 or fp32 (any kernel family supports either)
    kernelId : optional explicit override. When given, bypass CSV / C++
        dispatch and launch this specific tuned instance via
        opus_gemm_a16w16_tune.
    splitK : optional literal KBatch; only honored when kernelId is set.
    out : optional preallocated [batch, M, N] output; reused instead of
        allocating a fresh tensor.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor with shape [M, N] when A was 2D, [batch, M, N] when A was 3D.
