"""Framework tuner for the opus fp8 e8m0 mxscale flatmm split-K BMM (DSV4 wo_a).

Wired into the canonical :class:`GemmCommonTuner`, so it runs like the other
aiter GEMM tuners: multi-GPU via ``mp_tuner``, standard ``-i/--untune_file`` /
``-o/--tune_file`` CLI, batching, and the shared post-process / CSV writer.

The candidate pool lives here (``_TUNE_POLICY``). Per kid it holds only the
split-K factors to sweep; tile geometry, kernelName and the M alignment come from
the codegen instance table, so a kid cannot be tuned on a shape its launcher
rejects. That alignment used to be a second hand-maintained column and was wrong
in both directions -- it hid kid326, which is really arbitrary-M, from every
unaligned shape while the runtime dispatched it there anyway.

Runtime schema (what the tuner emits, and what the runtime reads back):
    gfx,b,m,n,k,w_scale_block,libtype,kernelId,splitK,us,kernelName,tflops,bw,errRatio
``aiter/ops/opus/policy.py:lookup_mxscale_bmm_config`` indexes on
``["gfx","b","m","n","k","w_scale_block"]`` (OPUS kids read a 128x128 or a
32x32 w_scale, and each block gets its own row), dispatches to a backend
on the winning row's ``libtype``, and the existing A8W8 caller passes ``kernelId`` / ``splitK`` to
the batch-first ``opus_bmm`` entry, so
those columns must match exactly.

The shipped schema has no output-dtype key. This tuner deliberately measures
the production BF16 route; FP32 production calls can execute the selected kid,
but do not have an independently tuned winner in this CSV format.

Verification (the part that catches column-transpose / scale defects):
  * inputs are *signed* and have *per-128-K-block varied magnitude*
    (``randn * 2**randint(-4,4)`` per block) so the e8m0 128-block scales span
    many exponents. Uniform non-negative ``rand()/10`` data hides a pure output
    column permutation (kid312/313 measured ~0.007 there but ~0.7-1.0 on real
    signed data) -- see the opus_bmm.md root-cause note.
  * reference is a dequantized fp32 einsum.
  * output is allocated as contiguous ``[M,G,N]`` exactly like production and
    passed to the batch-first public API through a transpose view. The existing
    batch-first activation/scale storage is retained, matching the canonical
    production transpose-view inputs.
  * gate: ``mp_tuner`` runs ``checkAllclose(rtol=1e-2, atol=1e-2)`` and
    ``post_process`` keeps the fastest candidate whose mismatch fraction is
    ``<= --errRatio`` (default 0.02). A still-broken tileN COM_REP_N>1 kernel
    measures ~0.5 here and is rejected; the fp8 e8m0 quant floor is ~1e-4.

Usage (gfx950 only; the repo root must be on PYTHONPATH so the edited/rebuilt
tree wins over any installed aiter):
    cd <repo> && PYTHONPATH=$PWD \\
        python3 csrc/opus_gemm/opus_bmm_mxscale_tune.py -g 16 -m 1,16,64 -n 1024 -k 4096

    # tune shipped shapes not already present in the diffable output copy;
    # add --all to force every shipped shape to be measured again:
    ... opus_bmm_mxscale_tune.py

    # overwrite the shipped tuned CSV in place (--apply implies --all):
    ... opus_bmm_mxscale_tune.py --apply

    # from an untuned CSV (columns: b,m,n,k -- or g,m,n,k), 8-way parallel:
    ... opus_bmm_mxscale_tune.py -i my_untuned.csv -o /tmp/out.csv --mp 8

    # the shipped shapes retuned into the second, preshuffle-inclusive table
    # (BPRESHUFFLE_CSV below; leaves the shipped one alone):
    ... opus_bmm_mxscale_tune.py --bpreshuffle --all --mp 8

    # what preshuffling B is worth: the same shapes twice, pool split by B layout,
    # then compare the two tables cell by cell:
    ... opus_bmm_mxscale_tune.py -i shapes.csv -o /tmp/rowb.csv --pool rowb --mp 8
    ... opus_bmm_mxscale_tune.py -i shapes.csv -o /tmp/preb.csv --pool preb --mp 8

# Priced, in case a quantiser can emit it, and the answer is no. The axis measures on

# over the 133-cell preshuffle envelope the seven wave8 pairs come out at 1.004x median

# kid214/168 1.023x against kid217/184 0.860x). kid208's A-only mpack layout is a
# separate decision and a clear no at 0.903x.
#
# The pool-level number to trust is best-shuffle_scale against best-plain-scale, both
# sides drawing the whole pool. Comparing against the *table's* pick instead prices the
# table's sub-optimality along with the layout, which is what made an earlier pass read
# 25 of 133 cells better by >1%. Full pool both sides, 12 shapes x 3 K, order rotated:
# median -0.80% at K=1024, -4.25% at K=4096, -5.74% at K=8192, 4 of 36 cells better by
# >1% and none at K=8192.
#
# Two things that number is not. It is not a property of the layout uniformly: measured
# twin against twin, the shuffled read beats the LDS panel at every K on kid334's
# 64x32x256 (1.108x/1.041x/1.038x against kid172) and loses a fifth on kid335's
# 128x128x128 (0.984x/0.805x/0.793x against kid184), so the pool reads negative because
# the pool's top is the tiles where it loses. Which tile property that is remains open --
# those two kids differ in four parameters, and kid215 rules out the obvious answer by
# being B_K=256/COM_REP_K=2 and losing anyway; see opus_gemm_common.py's kid334/335
# entry. And it is not measured with the scale prefetch missing any more: kid334/335 are
# kid216/217 with PREFETCH_SCALE on, worth only 1-2% here against flatmm's 1.139x, but
# their absence was half the apparent decay with K (the same sweep without them reads
# -0.43% / -5.97% / -10.82%). The wave8n4/wavetm1 kids cannot be measured with it at
# all -- that pipeline static_asserts !PREFETCH_SCALE.
#
# Past K=8192 the panel does not fit and 21 of 99 kids stop dispatching at splitK=1,
# which looks like the layout's opening: at splitK=1 the fastest kid at K=16384/32768 is
# a shuffle_scale kid in all 10 cells measured. But the bound is per split -- the
# launcher checks ceil(total_iters/split_k) <= SF_PRELOAD_K_MAX/B_K -- so a plain-scale
# preload kid reaches K=32768 at split_k>=4 today. Swept over split_k in {1,2,4,8} the
# advantage is gone: median -3.1%, 0 of 10 cells better by >1%, kid194 taking 6 of 10.
#
# That held only because every shape in the sweep leaves the machine half empty -- the
# largest, g2/m4096, is 128 workgroups at B_M=256 against 256 CUs, so split-K was partly
# buying parallelism the shape lacked. On shapes that fill it (g16/m4096 is 2048 WGs) at
# K=16384/32768, split_k=1 takes 6 of 6 cells and no panel kid dispatches there at all,
# so kid213 (shuffle_scale) wins every cell with the best panel kid 1.068-1.144x behind.
# The full kid x split_k grid says that win is split_k=1's and not the layout's: at every
# split_k both families reach, the panel kid is 0.75-0.83x the shuffle_scale kid. So the
# 7-14% is the K bound charging rent, collectable either by emitting shuffle_scale (worth
# it only in this regime) or by letting the faster family into the split_k=1 column.
#
# Which is worth doing, because the bound is not each kid's. The panel is
# (SFA rows + SFB rows) * K/GROUP_K bytes with SFA rows == B_M, and reading
# .group_segment_fixed_size out of the built code objects puts 19 of 25
# panel kids at 3-884x of unused headroom: kid208 (mpack_sfa, SFA from global, 2 SFB rows)
# could take K=7.2M per split, kid205 111,360, kid194 30,976. Only 158/196/228/230/324/326
# are genuinely full, and 151,680 -- the figure the traits comment justifies 8192 with --
# is kid158/196's, a pipeline whose staging is the 2*(B_M+B_N)*B_K double buffer and not
# the flatmm/wave8 families the constant also governs. Chunked refills are forced only for
# those 6.
#
# So the wave8 traits now derives SF_PRELOAD_K_MAX from the LDS its staging leaves over
# (capped at 32768, with a 256-byte reserve for allocator padding), which gives kid194
# 30,848 and the B_M=128 kids 30,464 -- the latter is not the cap because the budget is
# the LDS share that keeps the kernel's workgroups resident, not the whole CU. Spending
# the whole CU is what the first cut did, and it cost kid203/kid205 1.19-1.20x at m>=1536:
# they are 256-thread workgroups that fit a CU twice at 59,012 bytes and once at 83,972.
# See the SF_PANEL_LDS_CEILING note in the traits. At split_k=1 and K=16384 on machine-filling shapes
# that is worth 3.0-4.0% over kid213, 8/8 paired draws in each of three shapes, bit-exact.
# Less than the 17-25% the shared-split_k columns suggest, because the panel's edge falls
# from 0.79x at sk2/sk4 to 0.97x at sk1 -- kid213 gains more from that column than the
# panel kids do. K=32768 stays kid213's: a 256x256 tile needs a 66,048-byte panel against
# 62,208 of headroom, the one cell where a chunked refill is the only lever left (it would
# have to find 5.3%). No shipped row moves -- this table is K in {1024, 4096} at splitK=1
# -- so the gain is available to whoever tunes large-K rows, and re-running all 133 rows
# shows no drift beyond the machine's own (1.011x affected over control).
#
# split_k 2-8 being free is measured, not assumed: the reduce sums an fp32 workspace in an
# fp32 accumulator and casts once, so splitting K is blocked summation. Against an fp64
# reference at K=32768 with positive operands the max relative error falls monotonically,
# 6.18e-06 at sk1 to 4.75e-06 at sk8; with bf16 output every split_k reads 1.327e-03 and
# the difference is invisible. The ceiling on split_k is the ">= 3 K-tiles per split"
# launcher check, not precision.
#
# One follow-on still declined: a deeper register prefetch cannot replace the panel. The
# shared BMM pipeline already stages scales in v_sfa[2][2] one to two K tiles ahead with
# SFA_VM in every vmcnt immediate, so latency is covered, and what the panel buys is
# SFA_VM==0 -- the scale load leaving every vmcnt wait, vmcnt being one in-order counter.
# More stages attack latency, not ordering.
# See the kid328-333 block in opus_gemm_common.py.
#
# One methodology note from that work, for anyone re-running a pool sweep here:
# stepping the candidate pool in kid order every draw is worth several percent to
# whoever runs first. Rescanning the 39-kid preshuffle pool that way produced three
# mis-ranks that all evaporated under a small pool with the order rotated and 12
# draws (kid196 at g4/m3072/k4096 read 64.09us in kid order and 73.35us rotated).
# Rank on a handful of candidates with rotated order and per-draw values, not on a
# median over a full-pool pass.

# Four of the 133 cells are slower here than the shipped table is with row-major

# to fall back to, and each row already names the fastest preshuffled kid the
# entry can dispatch (re-swept over the whole pool at re-drawn placements). Two of

# g16/m256/k4096 is kid325 against kid229 (+14%) -- and neither is a cost of the
# layout. Those two kids compile to identical VGPR/AGPR/LDS with no spill, and the
# preshuffled one issues fewer instructions with the same 210 ds_read / 86
# buffer_load / 288 MFMA, so they move the same bytes doing the same work. Run as
# a pair across a g x m grid at both K they are a wash on 39 of 40 cells; the
# exception is the cell where the grid is exactly one occupancy wave (256
# workgroups on 256 CUs), where all workgroups march through K in phase and the
# memory pipe is already at its deepest queue. Profiled, the two are identical on
# every volume counter (L2 requests, hit rate, EA read requests all within 0.1%)
# and both spread perfectly evenly over the 128 memory channels, so it is not
# camping; the preshuffled side even takes 3x fewer tag stalls. It holds the
# channels 14% longer (TCC_BUSY), and that is the only counter that tracks the
# gap -- the +11-15% EA read latency it also carries is present at 2 and 4 waves
# too, where preshuffle wins anyway. Thread trace puts the extra wave-time on
# s_barrier and takes it off the B loads, i.e. the consumers wait longer at the
# rendezvous for B to reach LDS, and shows workgroup durations spreading 13%
# across CUs inside one dispatch -- at one wave the kernel is the max of that
# spread, so a 1-3% shift in it is a 4-6% kernel. What the counters cannot see is
# the L2 set index: 16 channels x 128 B means it advances per 2 KiB and wraps at
# 256 KiB, so the 64 KiB panel stride puts the tile's 8 chunks on 4 sets, and the
# n-tile and batch strides are whole multiples of the wrap so every workgroup
# picks the same 4. Padding stride_b (a kargs field taken from wo_a.stride(1), so
# no kernel change) to 72 KiB takes the cell from 0.87x to 0.98x and does nothing
# at the strides and wave counts that were already fine; across a wider pad sweep
# every stride landing on 8 sets runs 0.98-1.00x and every one landing on <=4 runs
# 0.87-0.94x. This is the stride and not the shuffle -- the shuffle only multiplies
# B's stride by 16 (K -> 16*K, four bits out of the set index), and forcing a
# 16 KiB row stride on the row-major baseline costs it 20%, more than preshuffle
# ever loses. Not shipped: 12.5% of weight memory for one cell. split_k>1 breaks
# the lockstep but costs more than it saves.
#
# The other two are g2/m512/k1024 (+6.4%) and g2/m1024/k1024 (+4.2%), where the
# row-major side is the heuristic, not a row.
#
# g2/m32768/k4096 was a fifth at +2.4%, and was not a layout cost at all: kid196
# (kid158's own pipeline reading a preshuffled B) and kid205 both land within 1%
# of row-major there, and the row named kid194, the slowest of the three. It now
# names kid205, and g16/m4096/k4096 -- same family, same mis-rank -- now names
# kid196. Neither was visible to the sweep that wrote them, because the candidates
# sit inside 2% of each other and a single pass ranks them by luck. The other 15
# rows naming kid194 were re-checked and it is the right pick on all of them.
#
# Two measurement traps here, each of which inverted an answer before it was found:
#   * run_perftest deep-copies the arguments it is handed into rotate_args sets and
#     cycles them, so the timed kernel reads a weight it did not just read.
#     Operands captured in a zero-argument closure are not arguments, and all 101
#     iterations then hit one cache-resident copy -- worth 14% to the 8-wave kids,
#     enough to make kid175 look like it beat row-major at g16/m128 by 1.4% when
#     it and kid230 are a wash.
#   * the placement note in opus_gemm_common.py, that at K=4096 a kernel's time
#     depends on where its weight buffer landed, does not cover these cells, but
#     had to be ruled out rather than assumed: the two sides necessarily hold
#     different buffers, so a single allocation bakes one placement difference into
#     the comparison. Over 8 draws that move both buffers, every gap above holds
#     its sign and no kernel varies by more than 4%.

    They are also built here rather than closed over, which is the whole point.
    run_perftest deep-copies the *arguments* it is handed into rotate_args sets
    and cycles them, so the timed kernel reads a scale slab it did not just read.
    Operands captured in a closure are not arguments, and every iteration then
    hits one cache-resident copy -- and a hot scale cache is precisely the regime
    in which the shuffled layout's only claim (16 lanes covering one 64B line
    where the plain layout touches 16) cannot show up. A closure here would bias
    the answer toward "shuffle buys nothing" by construction.
