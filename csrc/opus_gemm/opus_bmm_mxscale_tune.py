"""MXFP8 BMM tuning through the shared GEMM tuner framework.

The CSV key is (gfx, b, m, n, k, w_scale_block); existing scale rows are
preserved. Shape-only inputs may specify --groupSize 32,128. Tuning uses
BF16 output, token-major contiguous activations/scales, and the per-kid
weight layout. All operands are passed to mp_tuner for buffer rotation.

Use -i/-o for input/output CSVs, --all to retune existing rows, --run_config
for saved or default configurations, and --compare --update_improved for
production-operator comparisons. The joint OPUS/FlyDSL entry point is
csrc/bmm_a8w8_mxscale/bmm_a8w8_mxscale_bpreshuffle_tune.py.
