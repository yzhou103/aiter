"""Cross-arch shared codegen helpers + emit registry.

Each arch module under codegen/ self-registers its emit functions at import
time via register_emit(arch, kernel_tag, fn).  The entry-point gen_instances.py
imports each arch module (triggering registration) and dispatches via
dispatch_emit(cg, k, **kwargs).  Adding a new arch (e.g. gfx1250) = one new
file + one new import; entry point itself is arch-agnostic.
