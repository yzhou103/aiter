// shuffle_scale words through the LDS panel instead of reading them from global
// on every K tile. The two do not buy the same thing -- the panel gets the scale
// load off the vmcnt critical path, the layout fills op_sel at COM_REP_M < 4 --
// and the panel holds the shuffled dwords verbatim, so only where the word comes
// from moves. SF_PREFETCH turns off with it, existing to hide a load that no
// longer happens. Per-kid rather than a macro.

// Scaled MFMA over the register tile with M-packed A scales and staged B waits.
//
// v_sfa holds, per K group, the COM_REP_M e8m0 bytes of this lane's M subtiles
// in subtile order, so each MFMA picks its byte with the hardware scale_op_sel
// immediate and no pack ALU at all (the shifts fold away: the bytes are already
// adjacent in the register the ds_read landed them in). op_sel indexes one dword,
// so subtile im reads dword im/4 at immediate im%4 -- one dword per K group on
// the 4x2 grid, two on the 2x4 one.
//
// The subtile loop runs n-repeat outermost so that B, which arrives in n-repeat
// order, can be waited on a piece at a time: before n-repeat j only the loads up
// to j need to have landed, and the COM_REP_M MFMAs of every earlier n-repeat
// are already in flight covering them. B_TRAIL is the number of vmcnt entries
// issued after this tile's B (the next A tile's async copies), which the caller
// knows and this loop cannot.
//
// SHUFFLE_SCALE takes the scale words already packed, so
// nothing is packed here: the MFMA picks its byte with
// scale_op_sel = (KP << 1) | (M subtile parity), one immediate for both operands
// since B's dword doubles each byte and spends no bit on M. KP is the K tile's
// parity within its pair, hence a template parameter, and the caller unrolls K
// by two. The M half is (m / SF_SUB) & 1, not im & 1 -- sf_slot/sf_mbit below
// apply SF_GEOM's decomposition of it.

// codegen'd launcher can instantiate this exactly like the shared kernel; only
// the one combination this file implements is accepted.
//
// SFA_MPACK_GLOBAL moves the A panel out of LDS: the host hands it over already
// M-packed (shuffle_scale_mxsk_mpack), so a K tile's scales are one global load
// of COM_REP_M adjacent bytes and there is no panel to stage. It is its own flag
// rather than PRELOAD_SF_LDS=false because that combination means something else
// in the shared kernel -- read the plain layout per K tile -- and a kid handed
// the wrong A-scale layout returns wrong numbers rather than failing.
// XCD_WGM > 0 turns on the L2 rasterization below; it is the band height in M
// tiles. 0 is the plain linear map.
//
// SHUFFLE_SCALE takes both scale panels from global in the reference kernel's layout
// (shuffle_scale_a / _b) and reads them one dword per (subtile pair, K tile
// pair). Against SFA_MPACK_GLOBAL, which packs four M subtiles into a dword and
// leaves the row axis outside at the panel's K pitch, this trades one dwordx2 per
// K tile for one dword per two K tiles per subtile pair -- the same bytes and the
// same instruction count, but the row axis now sits at a stride of one dword, so
// 16 lanes hit one 64B line instead of 16. It implies its own K unroll of two,
// and so needs K % (2*B_K) == 0.
//
// SF_SHUF_IN_LDS stages those shuffled words through the LDS panel instead; see the
// note at the top of this file. It requires SHUFFLE_SCALE and it requires the
// panel to fit, and both are static_asserts rather than a silent downgrade.
